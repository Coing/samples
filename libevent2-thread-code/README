Libevent2 update for Multithreaded, libvent-based socket server sample.

This is a Libevent 2.x compatible version of Multithreaded, libevent-based
socket server sample written by Ronald Bennett Cemer. The original README is
kept as README.orig and the blog post about this sample is at:

http://www.roncemer.com/multi-threaded-libevent-server-example

LICENSE.txt along with the original code is kept. The license head in code
reflects the change I made but the original one is in the version history.

There are two changes comparing to the original sample package:
1. The original sample is written with Libevent 1.4.x, so I updated the code to
   compile with Libevent 2.x;
2. A Makefile is added for the ease of compilation and clean.

All the functionalities are kept the same as original sample.
